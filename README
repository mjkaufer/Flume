Flume

This is Flume, a CMS. To get started, drag flume somewhere, cd to its directory, open the console, and enter 'meteor'. That's it. Then, all you need to do is make an account. The first account created is automatically an admin, so you should be an admin. Set the name of your CMS by inputting it in the text field which appears. 

Every time you download a new commit thing, make sure you go to Flume/.meteor/local/ and delete the entire /db/ folder. 

It turns out that this won't work on the meteor servers so far, as they don't support file read/writes. I'll be searching for a way to make this app deployable on windows & other OSs.
